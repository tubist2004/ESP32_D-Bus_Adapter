# ESP32_D-Bus_Adapter

This is a repository for building a (or more) ESP32 based D-Bus Adapter for BSH appliances.

It is based on the awesome work of [@hn](https://github.com/hn) who did reverse engineering of the protocol, wrote some software and most important: Talked about it!

Please follow his project: https://github.com/hn/bsh-home-appliances
